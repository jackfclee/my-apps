    <question>Anonymous users from all over the world access a public information website hosted in an on-premises data center. The servers that host this website are older, and users are complaining about slow response times. There has also been an increase in distributed denial-of-service attacks targeting a website in recent times. Attacks always come from the same IP address ranges. The management has identified the public information website as an easy, low risk application to migrate to Google Cloud. You need to improve access latency and provide a security solution that will prevent the denial-of-service traffic from entering your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.

    <question>Refer to the EHR Healthcare case study for this question: https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/master_case_study_ehr_healthcare.pdf
EHR is interested in establishing a connection between one of its data centers and Google Cloud. However, the data center is situated in a remote location that is over 100 kilometers away from a Google-owned point of presence (POP). Budget constraints prevent them from acquiring new hardware, but  an existing firewall can accommodate future throughput growth. Additionally, they provided the following information:
- communication is required between servers in their on-premises data center and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) resources in the cloud
- both on-premises servers and cloud resource are set up with private RFC 1918 IP addresses
- the service provider has notified the customer that basic internet connectivity is provided as a best-effort service and does not come with any service level agreement (SLA)

    <question>One of your web application is becoming widely used. The frontend runs in App Engine and scales automatically. The backend runs in a Managed Instance Group on Compute Engine with the maximum number of instances set to 10. Sometimes the frontend sends more data than the backend can keep up and the data is lost, but you do not want to increase the maximum size of the MIG or change the VM instance type. As a cloud architect, what can you recommend to prevent data loss?</question>

    <question>The game's backend APIs run on a fleet of virtual machines behind a Managed Instance Group with autoscaling enabled. The scaling policy on this group adds more instances if the CPU utilization is consistently over 80%, and to scale down when the CPU utilization is consistently lower than 60%. You've noticed that autoscaling adds more virtual machines than necessary when scaling up, and you suspect that this may be due to a misconfiguration in health checks - the initial health check latency is set to 30 seconds. Each virtual machine takes less than 3 minutes to be ready to process requests. What can you do to fix this issue?</question>
