    <question>You are a developer working on an internal application for payroll processing. You are building a component of the application that allows an employee to submit a timesheet, which then initiates several steps:
- An email is sent to the employee and manager, notifying them that the timesheet was submitted.
- A timesheet is sent to payroll processing for the vendor's API.
- A timesheet is sent to the data warehouse for headcount planning.
These steps are not dependent on each other and can be completed in any order. New steps are being considered and will be implemented by different development teams. Each development team will implement the error handling specific to their step. What should you do?</question>

    <question>Your ecommerce application receives external requests and forwards them to third-party API services for credit card processing, shipping, and inventory management as shown in the diagram.
- The client accesses Load Balancer.
- The Load Balancer forwards the request to GKE.
- After GKE, there are three different services: Credit Card Processing, Shipping, and Inventory.
Your customers are reporting that your application is running slowly at unpredictable times. The application doesnâ€™t report any metrics. You need to determine the cause of the inconsistent performance.
