    <question>Your team is developing an application in Google Cloud that executes with user identities maintained by Cloud Identity. Each of your application's users will have an associated Pub/Sub topic to which messages are published, and a Pub/Sub subscription where the same user will retrieve published messages.You need to ensure that only authorized users can publish and subscribe to their own specific Pub/Sub topic and subscription.
- User Identity uses App Engine #1.
- User Identity uses App Engine #2.
- App Engine #1 forwards the call to Cloud Pub/Sub topic.
- Topic has a queued messages.
- App Engine #2 has a subscription to Queued Message on Cloud Pub/Sub topic.

    <question>You are a lead developer working on a new retail system that runs on Cloud Run and Firestore in Datastore mode. A web UI requirement is for the system to display a list of available products when users access the system and for the user to be able to browse through all products. You have implemented this requirement in the minimum viable product (MVP) phase by returning a list of all available products stored in Firestore.
A few months after go-live, you notice that Cloud Run instances are terminated with HTTP 500: Container instances are exceeding memory limits errors during busy times. This error coincides with spikes in the number of Datastore entity reads. You need to prevent Cloud Run from crashing and decrease the number of Datastore entity reads. You want to use a solution that optimizes system performance.
